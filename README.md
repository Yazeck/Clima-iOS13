# Clima (iOS13)

A simple weather app built with Swift and UIKit for iOS.  
This version uses **predefined static data** instead of connecting to a live weather API, making it ideal for learning UI layout, navigation, and basic data handling in iOS development.

## Features

- Displays city name, temperature, and weather condition.
- Simple and clean UI design.
- Light and dark background assets.
- Preloaded weather data (no internet connection required).
- MVC architecture for better separation of concerns.
